1. On a map, the distance from point A to point B is {always, sometimes, never} shorter or equal to the distance from point A to any waypoint C to point B.  

2. Imagine you could choose one example of the TSP to be instantly solved, no matter the size. An example is a specific set of points and the distances between all pairs of points. It does not have to be related to geography at all. Describe the instance of the problem, why you chose it, and the possible implications of having a solution. Examples in the reading (and supplemental reading by Applegate & Cook) are a good place to get ideas, but get creative - will you get famous, make the world a better place, make your life easier, make a lot of money, create art, etc.?  

3. The 6-core GPU in my iPhone can perform in the ballpark of 300 GFLOPS (3E11 computations per second). Make the same assumptions as I did in class for the supercomputer calculation (and in Cook, pg. 3). If a k-city TSP takes (k-1)!/2 calculations, what's the largest problem that can be solved in less than a day and how long will it take?

4. The 2-million-city "world tour" described in Cook (pg. 15) has been solved to within at most 0.0476% of the proven optimum. Is this good enough? Give one potential argument why this solution is "good enough" and one argument why research should be done to find a shorter path. What do *you* think?  

4. After completing the Khan Academy activities, think about what algorithms are used by your favorite games and apps. Give two examples.  

5. What are you most interested in learning about in this class? Based on the syllabus and course description, is there anything missing that you would like to cover?
