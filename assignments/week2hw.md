## Homework 2

Please email your answers to these questions to cdarby at jhu.edu by September 28 at 1:30 PM  

1. Read about [WhoSampled](https://www.whosampled.com/about/). What is one way that the WhoSampled database could be stored as a graph? (e.g. what are nodes and edges)

2. Try out the [SixDegrees](https://www.whosampled.com/six-degrees/) game. Based on the database you described in Q1, describe an algorithm that can determine whether there exists a path with at most 6 links from artist X to artist Y. Make sure your procedure or pseudocode is complete and specific!

3. How does your algorithm tell when there is NO connection between artist X and artist Y? Optional challenge: Can you find a pair of artists in the SixDegrees game with no connection, or a path with more than 6 links?

4. The *set cover* problem is NP-Complete.  
Imagine a bunch of objects. You are given many different lists of specific objects. Every object in the bunch is guaranteed to be in at least one list. You need to find the fewest number of lists such that every object is in at least one of the lists. Lists have no repeated objects.   
Create a "real-world" analogy for this problem like those in Chapter 3. (It doesn't need to be about friendships or even people.)

5. If you were not able to attend Professor Aaronson's lecture on Thursday morning (or even if you did!) read chapter 9 of The Golden Ticket. Write in your own words one concept about quantum computing that piques your interest AND write one lingering question you have about the topics in the lecture and/or the chapter.
