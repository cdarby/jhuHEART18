## Homework 3

1. "No matter how you try to find that ticket, you will need a considerable amount of time, money, or luck. Maybe someday someone will develop a cheap device that will let you find that ticket quickly, or maybe such a device will never exist." (pg. 2) Fortnow makes an allegory between the fictional search for the "golden ticket" voucher in a chocolate bar and making algorithms to find the one best answer to a problem. Briefly describe your own idea of an allegory for the concept of P versus NP. No extra research is required - base your answer on what you learned about P versus NP and algorithms from class and the reading.

2. In your own words, what is the difference between a decision and an optimization problem? Give an example of each.
