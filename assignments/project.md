## Course Project

You will give a mini-lesson that is about 15-20 minutes long. Use this opportunity to go deeper into a topic that really interested you, learn about something we didn't cover in class, or find out how these algorithms are practically applied.

3 students will present on Nov. 16; 3 students will present on Nov. 30. You will choose your presentation date in class on Nov. 2nd and tell me your lesson topic one week before your presentation (at the latest).

- The format of the lesson is quite flexible. Make a handout, write on the board, speak from notes, use a powerpoint, etc.
- Please do not show a video for your lesson; however, you may present any content or activity you learned from an educational video. Use any resources you want to prepare the presentation.
- Consider designing an activity, practice problem, or another type of interactive component to go along with your lesson.

Some ideas:  

- Explain a problem we haven't covered, possibly with an analogy like "Frenemy" or the "USA road map." A list of NP-Complete problems would be a good place to start.  
- Explain another algorithm, approximation, or heuristic for a problem we did cover in class  
- Expand on an idea mentioned in The Golden Ticket ch. 10  
- Talk about applications of NP-complete or NP-hard problems in an area of science or engineering. This is a great opportunity to connect to another area you are interested in.  
- Other complexity classes besides P, NP, NP-hard, NP-complete, co-NP
