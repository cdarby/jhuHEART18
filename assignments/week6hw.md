## Homework 6

Please email your answers to these questions to cdarby at jhu.edu by November 2 at 1:30 PM

Your assignment this week is to do some background research to prepare you for our in-class activities. You will become familiar with Boolean logic and circuits, described in The Golden Ticket chapter 7 (pg. 113-118).

- Look for videos, "question-answer" boards, and textbook-like tutorials online. University course notes and slides may also be helpful advanced resources.
- I encourage you to take notes on your research and bring them to class.  
- Bring lingering questions to class, do research with your classmates, and email me at any time.
